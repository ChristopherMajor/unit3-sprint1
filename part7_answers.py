What, in your opinion, is an important part of code reviews?
    I think it's good to make sure code is pep8 compliant, 
    and to make sure they are testing their code properly to
    make sure it does what it is supposed to do. Also to make sure 
    there is proper documentation and README files. 

How could containers help us improve this situation?
    containers package everything into standardized units so the code runs quicker
    and evenly on all different platforms(windows, linux,macOS)
